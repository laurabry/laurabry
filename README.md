🔬 Former molecular biologist turned data scientist, with a PhD and a passion for solving real-world problems through data.

🧠 My scientific background shaped how I think: analytical, curious, and detail-oriented. Now I bring that mindset into the world of data science.

📊 I love exploring data, uncovering patterns, and building machine learning models that are prectical and useful.

💡 Currently diving deep into time series analysis, machine learning, and data visualization — and always excited to learn new tools and techniques.


📍 Based in Hamburg, open to opportunities and collaborations!  
🌱 Always learning, always building.
